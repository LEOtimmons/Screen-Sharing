# Screen-Sharing

The Screen - Sharing tool is inspirited by working in office since covid-19 , all colleague needs to keep epidemic prevention distance from others.

Instead of walking up to someone , using this tool is much safer when the epidemic is severe.

Features of the tool :

  1.One Host Can Accept Multi Client And Streaming The Host's Screen On Time.
  
  2.If Host Is Shutdown Accidentily , Clients Will Automatically Reconnect When Host Raises Again.
  
  3.Host's Panal Can See All Of Client Which Is Connected.
  
  

Some features I want to add in the future :

  1.To integrate both host and client into one program.
  
  2.Provide a platform for users to raise / connect the service.
  
  3.Adding the function like chatroom make communication easier(maybe some emoji or sticker would be added too).
  
  4.Support file transfer function.
  
 
All progress comes from the inconvenience of life :)
